## Quick Start

### One-Command Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control.git
cd mission-control
bash install.sh --local     # or: bash install.sh --docker
```

After installation:

```bash
open http://localhost:3000/setup    # create your admin account
```

The installer handles Node.js 22+, pnpm, dependencies, and auto-generates secure credentials. For Windows, use `.\install.ps1 -Mode local` in PowerShell.

### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control.git
cd mission-control
nvm use 22 && pnpm install
pnpm dev                    # http://localhost:3000/setup
```

### Docker Zero-Config

```bash
docker compose up           # auto-generates credentials, persists across restarts
```

### Prebuilt Images

The project publishes multi-arch images to GHCR on main and version tags.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/builderz-labs/mission-control:latest
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/builderz-labs/mission-control:latest
```

Docker Hub publishing is optional and may depend on org package visibility/secrets. If `docker.io/builderz-labs/mission-control` is unavailable, use GHCR.

For production hardening (read-only filesystem, capability dropping, HSTS, network isolation):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.hardened.yml up -d
```

---

## Why teams adopt Mission Control

- Predictable orchestration: one dashboard for task flow, dispatch, quality gates, and audit trails.
- Faster operator response: real-time agent/task/security telemetry without stitching tools together.
- Local-first deployment: SQLite-backed stack with no mandatory Redis/Postgres dependency.
- Security by default: RBAC, trust scoring, secret detection, and hardened deployment profile.

## Use-case recipes

1) Stand up a local control center in 5 minutes
- Run `bash install.sh --local`
- Open `/setup`
- Create your first agent and task from the UI

2) Run multi-agent workflows with quality gates
- Register specialist agents (research, coding, reviewer)
- Enable orchestration rules and quality review
- Track handoffs end-to-end in the Kanban board

3) Operate production safely
- Deploy with `docker-compose.hardened.yml`
- Configure `MC_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and TLS reverse proxy
- Monitor trust score + security audit panels continuously

4) Integrate existing CLI agents without re-platforming
- Connect Claude Code/Codex via CLI integration
- Keep your current workflows while adding centralized observability and controls

---

## Getting Started with Agents

Register your first agent in under 5 minutes — no gateway required:

```bash
export MC_URL=http://localhost:3000
export MC_API_KEY=your-api-key   # shown in Settings after first login

# Register an agent
curl -X POST "$MC_URL/api/agents/register" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "scout", "role": "researcher"}'

# Create a task
curl -X POST "$MC_URL/api/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MC_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Research competitors", "assigned_to": "scout", "priority": "medium"}'

# Poll the queue as the agent
curl "$MC_URL/api/tasks/queue?agent=scout" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MC_API_KEY>"
```

For the full walkthrough, see the **[Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md)**.

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) | Register an agent, create a task, complete it — 5 minutes |
| [Agent Setup](docs/agent-setup.md) | SOUL personalities, config, heartbeats, agent sources |
| [Orchestration](docs/orchestration.md) | Multi-agent workflows, auto-dispatch, quality review gates |
| [CLI Reference](docs/cli-agent-control.md) | Full CLI command list for headless/scripted usage |
| [CLI Integration](docs/cli-integration.md) | Connect Claude Code, Codex, or any CLI tool directly |
| [Deployment](docs/deployment.md) | Production deployment, reverse proxy, VPS setup |
| [Security Hardening](docs/SECURITY-HARDENING.md) | Docker hardening, CSP, network isolation |
| [Release Process](RELEASE.md) | SemVer policy, branch strategy, tag/release checklist |

### Gateway Optional Mode

Mission Control can run standalone without a gateway connection — useful for VPS deployments with firewall restrictions or when running primarily for project/task operations:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_OPTIONAL=true pnpm start
```

Task board, projects, agents, sessions, scheduler, webhooks, alerts, and cost tracking all work without a gateway. Real-time session updates and agent messaging require an active gateway connection.

## Features

### Agent Management

Monitor agent status, configure models, view heartbeats, and manage the full agent lifecycle from registration to retirement. Local agent discovery from `~/.agents/`, `~/.codex/agents/`, and `~/.claude/agents/`. Agent SOUL system with bidirectional workspace sync.

![Mission Control Agents Panel](docs/mission-control-agents.png)

### Task Board

Kanban board with six columns (inbox → assigned → in progress → review → quality review → done), drag-and-drop, priority levels, assignments, threaded comments, and inline sub-agent spawning. Multi-project support with per-project ticket prefixes.

![Mission Control Tasks Panel](docs/mission-control-tasks.png)

### Memory Knowledge Graph

Explore agent knowledge through the Memory Browser, filesystem-backed memory tree, and interactive relationship graph for sessions, memory chunks, and linked knowledge files.

![Mission Control Memory Graph](docs/mission-control-memory-graph.png)

### Skills Hub

Browse, install, and manage agent skills from local directories and external registries (ClawdHub, skills.sh). Built-in security scanner checks for prompt injection, credential leaks, data exfiltration, obfuscated content, and dangerous shell commands before installation. Supports 5 skill roots across `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, project-local directories, and `~/.openclaw/skills`.

### Cost Tracking

Token usage dashboard with per-model breakdowns, trend charts, and cost analysis. Session-level granularity powered by Recharts.

> Screenshot refresh pending: temporarily removed outdated image to avoid showing incorrect UI.

### Security Audit & Agent Trust

Real-time posture scoring (0-100), secret detection across agent messages, MCP tool call auditing, injection attempt tracking, and per-agent trust scores. Hook profiles (minimal/standard/strict) let operators tune security strictness per deployment.

> Screenshot refresh pending: temporarily removed outdated image to avoid showing incorrect UI.

### Agent Eval Framework

Four-layer evaluation: output evals (task completion scoring against golden datasets), trace evals (convergence/loop detection), component evals (tool reliability with p50/p95/p99 latency), and drift detection (10% threshold vs 4-week rolling baseline).

### Natural Language Recurring Tasks

Create recurring tasks with natural language like "every morning at 9am" or "every 2 hours". The built-in schedule parser converts expressions to cron and stores them in task metadata. A template-clone pattern keeps the original as a template and spawns dated child tasks on schedule.

![Mission Control Cron Panel](docs/mission-control-cron.png)

### Claude Code Integration

- **Session Tracking** — Auto-discovers local Claude Code sessions from `~/.claude/projects/`, extracts token usage, model info, cost estimates, and active status.
- **Task Bridge** — Read-only scanner surfaces team tasks and configs from `~/.claude/tasks/` and `~/.claude/teams/` on the dashboard.
- **Direct CLI** — Connect Claude Code, Codex, or any CLI tool directly without requiring a gateway.

### Activity Feed

Real-time activity stream across all agents, tasks, and system events. Filter by event type, agent, or time range.

![Mission Control Activity Panel](docs/mission-control-activity.png)

### Integrations

Outbound webhooks with delivery history, retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker, and HMAC-SHA256 signature verification. GitHub Issues sync with label/assignee mapping. Agent inter-agent messaging via the comms API.

### Framework Adapters

Built-in adapter layer for multi-agent registration: OpenClaw, CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, Claude SDK, and generic fallback. Each adapter normalizes registration, heartbeats, and task reporting to a common interface.

### Workspace Management

Multi-tenant workspace isolation via `/api/super/*` endpoints. Create client instances, monitor provisioning jobs, and decommission tenants with optional cleanup. Each workspace gets its own isolated environment with dedicated gateway and state directory.

## Environment Variables

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the complete list. Key variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_USER` | No | Initial admin username (default: `admin`) |
| `AUTH_PASS` | No | Initial admin password (auto-generated if unset) |
| `API_KEY` | No | API key for headless access (auto-generated if unset) |
| `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` | No* | Absolute path to `openclaw.json` |
| `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` | No* | Exact path to the OpenClaw state directory (default: `~/.openclaw`). Preferred over `OPENCLAW_HOME` — avoids double-nesting |

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev              # Dev server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check
pnpm lint             # ESLint
pnpm test             # Vitest unit tests (282)
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright E2E (295)
pnpm quality:gate     # All checks
```

### Diagnostics

```bash
bash scripts/station-doctor.sh     # Installation health check
bash scripts/security-audit.sh     # Security configuration audit
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Internal server error" on login | `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` (Node version mismatch) |
| Docker: gateway not connecting | Set `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_HOST=host.docker.internal` in `.env` |
| Docker: browser WebSocket fails | Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_HOST` empty (auto-detected) or set to a browser-reachable hostname |
| 404 on all pages | Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next && pnpm dev` |
| `AUTH_PASS` with `#` ignored | Quote it: `AUTH_PASS="my#pass"` or use `AUTH_PASS_B64` |

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for detailed troubleshooting.

## Security

- **Change all default credentials** before deploying
- **Deploy behind a reverse proxy with TLS** for any network-accessible deployment
- **Do not expose to the public internet** without configuring `MC_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and TLS
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting
